NetApp Cookbook
===============

The NetApp cookbook manages Clustered Data ONTAP clusters using the NetApp Manageability SDK. Both cluster-wide and Storage Virtual Machine (SVM, formerly known as Vservers) specific operations are supported.

The NetApp cookbook may also be used to manage the `netapp_role`, `netapp_volume`, and `netapp_qtree` resources on Cloud ONTAP on Amazon Web Services.

Requirements
------------
#### NetApp Manageability SDK Library v5.0

You may download it from [NetApp](http://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/software?product=NetApp+Manageability+SDK&platform=All+Platforms) after you have created an account on [NetApp NOW](https://support.netapp.com/eservice/public/now.do)

- Save the NetApp SDK to this NetApp cookbook in the "libraries" dir.

- Update the NaServer.rb to specify the path of NaElement. Replace the line:
` require NaElement
`
With -
` require File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/NaElement"
`

NetApp connection
-----------------
The ZAPI connection is made over HTTP or HTTPS, with a user account that exists on the NetApp storage cluster. If you specify an account that only has SVM administration privileges (rather than cluster administration privileges), some features of the NetApp cookbook will not work. The connection settings are managed by attributes in the cookbook but are also exposed in Common attributes for the NetApp resources.

    ['netapp']['url'] = 'https://root:secret@pfiler01.example.com/svm01'

or

    ['netapp']['https'] boolean, default is 'true'.
    ['netapp']['user'] string
    ['netapp']['password'] string
    ['netapp']['fqdn'] string
    ['netapp']['vserver'] string
    ['netapp']['asup'] boolean, default is 'true'.

The ASUP option, if set to 'true', will cause a log message to be sent to the storage cluster. This log message will be included in ASUP bundles that are sent back to NetApp, if configured to do so on the system. If ASUP is not enabled on the system or on the attribute listed above, no log message will be sent to NetApp.

NetApp Resources
================

Common Attributes
-----------------
In addition to those provided by Chef itself (`ignore_failure`, `retries`, `retry_delay`, etc.), the connection attribute(s) are exposed all NetApp Resources even though they are typically set by attributes.
